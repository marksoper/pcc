There's a lot of valuable knowledge about parenting coming out, but most parents are too busy to wade through the noise to find it. That's where I come in. My name is Mark Soper. I consume news constantly looking for interesting stories that relate to parenting and summarize them in a weekly email so busy parents can stay informed.
