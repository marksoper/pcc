## Comprehensive Study of Kids Well-Being Definitely Not Funded By New Mexico

The Annie E Casy Foundation released their [2013 Kids Count Data Book](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/publications/databook/2013 "2013 Kids Count Data Book") report on child and family well-being in the US.

- 54% of 3-4 year olds are NOT enrolled in pre-school

- California has the highest percentage of children - 52% - living in households spending more than 30 percent of income for housing

- Are US students falling behind other countries? Yes, but only our low-income students. Our growing wealth gap explains much of our recent decline in international comparisons. Students at US schools with fewer than 10% in poverty rank #1 globally in reading.

- ** New Mexico took over from Mississippi as the "worst state" in overall well-being of children. ** New Hampshire led a raft of New England states at the top of the pack.
