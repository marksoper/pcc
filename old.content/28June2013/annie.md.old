## American students falling behind? Yes and No

The Annie E Casy Foundation released their [2013 Kids Count Data Book](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/publications/databook/2013 "2013 Kids Count Data Book") report on child and family well-being in the US.

- We continue to improve steadily in health and education. Economic well-being is up slightly in the past year but has been in decline over the past decade.

- 54% of 3-4 year olds are NOT enrolled in pre-school

- California has the highest percentage of children - 52% - living in households spending more than 30 percent of income for housing

- Are US students falling behind other countries? Yes, but only our low-income students. Our growing wealth gap explains much of our recent decline in international comparisons. Students at US schools with fewer than 10% in poverty rank #1 globally in reading.

- New Mexico took over from Mississippi as the "worst state" in overall well-being of children. New Hampshire led a raft of New England states at the top of the pack.

The charge that 
American students are falling behind 
comes from international comparisons, 
which typically rank the United States 
in the top third or half, depending on 
the age of students and subject matter 
being tested. But when researchers disaggregate the data, it becomes clear that 
our nation’s overall achievement levels 
are limited by the performance of our 
lowest-income students. 
Controlling for poverty, American 
students rank much higher.3
 In 2009, 
students at U.S. schools with fewer 
than 10 percent of students in poverty 
ranked number one in reading


in 2011, California had the highest 
percentage of children — a startling 
52 percent — living in households 
spending more than 30 percent of 
income for housing, whereas north 
Dakota had the lowest, 21 percent.

54% - percentage of 3 and 4 year olds not in preschool - From2009to2011,more

The child and teen death rate (deaths per 
100,000 children ages 1 to 19) reflects a 
broad array of factors: physical and mental 
health; access to health care; community 
factors (such as violence and environmental 
toxins); use of safety practices and, especially for younger children, the level of adult 
supervision. Accidents, primarily those 
involving motor vehicles, were the leading 
cause of death for children and youth, 
accounting for 32 percent of all deaths 
among children ages 1 to 14.31 As children 
move into their mid- and late-teenage years, 
they encounter new risks that can be deadly. 
In 2010, accidents, homicides and suicides 
accounted for 73 percent of deaths to teens 
ages 15 to 19.32
