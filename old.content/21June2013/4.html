<h2>Bullies Use Allergies Against Victims</h2>

<p>NY Times Journalist (and friend) Catherine Saint Louis reports that 1/3 of kids with food allergies reported being bullied for their allergy, with only 1/2 of those being reported to parents.  In some cases victims had peanut butter, milk, and other allergens thrown at them or forced into their mouths.</p>

<h2>Music Picks for Sing-Along, Dancing, and Baby Relaxation</h2>

<p>At our son&#39;s preschool graduation ceremony this week the teachers revealed one of their secrets to entertaining a gang of 4-year-olds.  After handing out diplomas they turned the event into a sing-along and dance party just like they&#39;ve done in class all year.  They started out with the kids seated in a circle singing along to a couple of tracks from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vol-2-We-All-Live-Together/dp/B00000AG62" title="We All Live Together by Greg &amp; Steve">We All Live Together Vol 2 by Greg &amp; Steve</a>, and then they busted out Go Baby Go by the Baby Loves Jazz Band and had the whole crew up and grooving, jumping around, and even breakdancing.</p>
