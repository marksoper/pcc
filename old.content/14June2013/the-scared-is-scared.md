### The Scared is Scared (*Short Film*) ###
Emerging film-maker Bianca Giaever asks six year boy Asa what he thinks a movie should be about.  Starts as an interesting testament to child creativity and then drops some wisdom on how to move on when something you like comes to an end - like "Who Moved My Cheese" but not nearly as cheesy.
