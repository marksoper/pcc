### Parenting in the Age of Digital Technology ###

  Northwestern University's Center on Media and Human Development published "Parenting in the Age of Digital Technology", an extensive survey of 2300 representative parents of 0-8 year olds nationwide. Key takeaways:

  1. Only 30% of parents are concerned about negative effects from smarthpones and tablets.  The main area where parents are concerned is negative impact of physical activity.

  2. Despite widespread adoption (71% of families have smartphones, 42% have tablets), parents don't believe these devices make parenting easier and still rely more on traditional tools like books and toys in educational situations and in keeping the child busy while doing chores.  New media are

### Amazon Victory Over Netflix ####

Last week I reported on Netflix losing streaming rights to Viacom's Nickelodeon catalog of Dora, Diego, SpongeBob, et al.  This week saw the announcement of Amazon picking up those rights in a record $200 million deal covering 4000 TV episodes, exceeding what used to be on Netflix.  San Jose Mercury News

We tried out Diego Volume One and it worked great.  You have more control (but more complexity) in Amazon vs. Netflix.  Episodes are like $1.99 or free if get $79/year Amazon Prime.

Just Because, That's Why!
-------------------------

** Why are there 7 days in a week? **

Correct answer: "I don't know".  The origin of the seven-day week is the religious significance that was placed on the seventh day by ancient cultures, including the Babylonian and Jewish civilizations.  Why the seventh day was annointed to the disappointment of six, eight, and other worthy numerical candidates is a mystery (I suspect papyrus attack ads were involved). A popular theory is that seven days is approximately one quarter of a lunar cycle, but there is no historical evidence of this intention. * The Seven Day Week on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-day_week) *

Activities and Hacks
--------------------

### Strings and Beads ###

Ensuring first that your kid doesn't swallow or choke on beads,  give your kid a shoestring and some beads. Optionally knot one end so they don't fall off.  Optionally combine this with "encouraging your kids to be entrepreneurial" and disrupt the necklace or bracelet markets.

### The Bear (*Picture Book*) ###

So often time spent with the kids amounts to:  I'm doing something meant for the kids (or vice versa).  Most picture books are this way for me, so it was refreshing to discover The Bear (http://mybear.net/) by Rebecca Dreistadt and Ryan Sohmer.  Dialog that explores new parents' feelings in a way that the child can interact with, and beautiful illustration, make the original (November 2012) and the forthcoming Kickstarter-funded second volume (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1412277313/the-bear-a-first-time-parents-continuing-journey) highly rated on the parent-child engagement scale.
