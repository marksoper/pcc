## Secret Tip To Make Kids Eat Healthy: Explain Nutrition

Stanford researchers have found that [young children are capable of understanding a conceptual approach to nutrition](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/july/kids-healthy-eating-070313.html "Kids eat more vegetables after nutrition lessons, Stanford study finds"). They used nutrition storybooks that doubled voluntary consumption of vegetables.  "What sets our materials apart from other approaches is the care we took to explain to children why their body needs different kinds of healthy food. We did not train children to eat more vegetables specifically." No word yet on how well this approach competes with pretending your kids are giants gobbling up "trees" of broccoli.

The Atlantic's Lindsay Abrams reports that children struggling with obesity respond best when [emphasis is placed on healthy diet instead of their body shape](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/06/study-when-talking-to-kids-about-obesity-focus-on-foods-not-body-shapes/277173/ "Study: When Talking to Kids About Obesity, Focus on Foods, Not Body Shapes").
