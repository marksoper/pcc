## Go The F*ck To Sleep Or Flunk Spatial Ability

Kids with irregular bedtimes on school nights at ages 3,5, and 7 underperformed in reading, math, and spatial ability tests taken at age 7, according to a [study by University College London](
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-08/irregular-bedtimes-tied-to-children-s-lower-test-scores.html "Irregular Bedtimes Tied to Childrenâ€™s Lower Test Scores") widely reported this week. The study shows correlation but not causation, perhaps not adding much to the already established facts about the importance of sleep in kids' mental and emotional functioning. See Po Bronson's ["Snooze Or Loose"](http://nymag.com/news/features/38951/ "Snooze or Loose by Po Bronson") in New York Magazine for a great overview of children's sleep research.
