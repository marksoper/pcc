Totally revolutionizing my perspective on Chuck E. Cheese's, The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal [interviews the founder to tell the remarkable story of the pizza arcade chain](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/chuck-e-cheeses-silicon-valley-startup-the-origins-of-the-best-pizza-chain-ever/277869/ "Chuck E. Cheese's, Silicon Valley Startup: The Origins of the Best Pizza Chain Ever"). Nolan Bushnell, from his vantage point as founder of Atari, saw better economics on the arcade side so he personally constructed everything from animatronic characters to pizza recipes to create the ultimate birthday venue for generations of kids.

Lest you think that the window of opportunity for gameroom innovation closed long ago, see how [a 9-year-old boy in East LA created a global phenomenon with his *cardboard* arcade](http://cainesarcade.com "Caine's Arcade").
