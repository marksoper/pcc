Ernst & Young [surveyed women in senior management](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alanaglass/2013/06/24/ernst-young-studies-the-connection-between-female-executives-and-sports/ "Ernst & Young Studies The Connection Between Female Executives And Sports") at large global companies, finding a big correlation between sports and career sucesss. 90% of the women surveyed had played sports either at primary and secondary school, or during university or other tertiary education - 96% for executive officers.

Research shows that women and girls who participate in sports are less likely to take drugs, engage in abusive relationships, or have unwanted pregnancies. And they are more likely to graduate from high school, receive post-graduate degrees, and earn more money.

I suspect, however, that there is something else more important – and subtle – going on too. Girls who play sport at school learn at a young age that it is acceptable to compete aggressively. They also discover that success does not depend on looking good and that it can be acceptable to take pleasure in winning. That might seem an obvious point, at least to an adult man. But it is not so self-evident to young girls who are exposed to modern Hollywood teen – or tweenie – culture. Indeed, when I look at the cultural messages that kids receive now from films and television, compared with my own childhood, I suspect that girls need sports today more than ever. Being an athlete is one of the few socially accepted ways for teenage girls to compete, without peer criticism.
