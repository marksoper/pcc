## On Trial in Kentucky: Raising Kids the Old Fashioned Way

Psychologist and old-school, Bible-based parenting expert John Rosemond is in a [legal battle over his nationally syndicated Q & A parenting advice news column](http://www.kentucky.com/2013/07/16/2716394/kentucky-agency-attempts-to-block.html "Advice columnist John Rosemond sues Kentucky agency, claiming censorship"). His parenting approach, which generally involves reverting back to how things were done 50+ years ago, [has been controversial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-belkin/john-rosemond-parent-babble-book-review_b_1965620.html). I wonder what he would say about [masturbation, the views on which have changed a lot over the years](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/06/how-to-address-the-masturbating-child/277026/ "How to Address the Masturbating Child")? No uncertainly about how our boys feel about it :)
