## Best Father's Day Gift: Criticism

SFSU Psychology Professor Jeff Cookston encourages dads to ask children for feedback on how they're parenting.  His research suggests that kids perceive their father's parenting differently than intended.  "You may think that you’re being a good parent by not being harsh on your kid, for instance, but your child may view that as 'you’re not invested in me, you’re not trying.'" said Cookston.

Cookston's work relates mostly to adolescents, but I decided to try his suggestion out with my 4 year old son.  "I don't know" was his response to "Am I doing a good job as a father?".  "Ok, that makes sense", I said, "I guess you don't have any other Dad for comparison".  "No only you, Dad!", he said, surprising me with a big smile and a hug that brought a tear to my eye.  I persisted, asking if there were ways I could improve as a parent.  He told me he wanted me to fight more often, specifically with his a friend from his pre-school class.  I told him I'd take it under consideration, but there's no way I'm going to mess with someone who wears a superman t-shirt every day.
