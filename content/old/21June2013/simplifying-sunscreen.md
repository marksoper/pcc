## Best Kids' Sunscreen: Coppertone SPF-50 Mineral-based Lotion

Summer's here, so I did a bunch of research on sunscreen this week.  Which sunscreen is best for Kids?

Buy any of these three 50-SPF Coppertone Mineral-based Sunscreens: [Coppertone Water Babies 50-SPF](http://www.ewg.org/2013sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/496161/Coppertone_Water_Babies_Pure_%26_Simple_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_50/ "Coppertone Water Babies"), [Coppertone Kids 50-SPF](http://www.ewg.org/2013sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/496123/Coppertone_Kids_Pure_%26_Simple_Lotion%2C_SPF_50/ "Coppertone Kids 50-SPF"), or [Coppertone Sensitive Skin 50-SPF](http://www.ewg.org/2013sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/496133/Coppertone_Sensitive_Skin_Suncreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_50/ "Coppertone Sensitive Skin 50-SPF")

Why? These three are the only widely-available lotion products that rated well in this [EWG study] (http://www.ewg.org/2013sunscreen/ "EWG Sunscreen Study").  Others tips: Don't use sprays, they can get into kids' eyes and mouths.

Did you know SPF-30 only blocks 1% less UV than SPF-50?
