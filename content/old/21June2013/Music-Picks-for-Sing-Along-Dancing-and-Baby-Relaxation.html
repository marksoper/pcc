At our son&#39;s preschool graduation ceremony this week the teachers revealed one of their secrets to entertaining a gang of 4-year-olds. &nbsp;After handing out diplomas they turned the event into a sing-along and dance party just like they&#39;ve done in class all year. &nbsp;They started out with the kids seated in a circle singing along to a couple of tracks from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vol-2-We-All-Live-Together/dp/B00000AG62" target="_self" title="We All Live Together by Greg & Steve">We All Live Together Vol 2 by Greg &amp; Steve</a>, and then they busted out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-Baby-Loves-Jazz/dp/B000G759FI" target="_self" title="Go Baby Loves Jazz">Go Baby Go by the Baby Loves Jazz Band</a>&nbsp;and had the whole crew up and grooving, jumping around, and even breakdancing.<br />
